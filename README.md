## Inspiration

App is based on the well-known web application [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). Why did I write it? Firstly, I wanted to learn writing android app in Java. Secondly, I didn't want to wait all day for a new word. App was created in polish language.

## How to use

You have to download compressed version [app/release/app-release.apk](https://github.com/gregori0o/wordle_app/blob/master/app/release/app-release.apk) and install it on your mobile phone.

## App

App allows to play in one of three modes. You can guess 5, 6, or 9 letter word.

In app there is short instruction of game rules.

In the game you have to guess word and click enter to validate it. After each guess the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to word. To change the word to guess click restart button in the upper right corner. Example of the game below:
